        Education can open our eyes and expand our minds unlike anything else. <br>
         It allows us to continually reshape how we see the world, leading to an improved and more well-rounded life. And it all starts with being a student.
         <br>
         Sometimes college is overwhelming. Your exams, essays, thesis, and due dates can turn into a heavy workload weighing you down. In these moments, you might ask yourself why you’re doing this to yourself, but don’t forget that you get to study a subject that you’re passionate about. When you enrolled, there was this hunger for learning inside you and all you have to do is find that motivation again.
