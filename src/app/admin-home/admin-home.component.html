        <h1>On Knowledge as Power</h1>
        <p>Barack Obama, 44th President of the United States: “In a global economy where the most valuable skill you can sell is your knowledge, a good education is no longer just a pathway to opportunity – it is a prerequisite.”

            Henry Louis Gates, Jr., historian and filmmaker: “The first step toward tolerance is respect and the first step toward respect is knowledge.”
            
            Confucius, teacher and philosopher: “Real knowledge is to know the extent of one's ignorance.”</p>

            <h1 class="d-flex justify-content-end">On Encouraging Excellence</h1>
            <p class="d-flex justify-content-end">Booker T. Washington, author and advisor to U.S. presidents: “Excellence is to do a common thing in an uncommon way.”

                Aristotle: “Excellence is an art won by training and habituation. We do not act rightly because we have virtue or excellence, but we rather have those because we have acted rightly. We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.”
                
                Barack Obama: “We need to internalize this idea of excellence. Not many folks spend a lot of time trying to be excellent.”</p>

    <h1>On Teaching</h1>
    <p >Albert Einstein: “If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.”

        Chris Dede, education researcher and innovator: “There is no single best way to teach because there is no single best way to learn.”
        
        Septima Poinsette Clark, civil rights activist: “I believe unconditionally in the ability of people to respond when they are told the truth. We need to be taught to study rather than believe, to inquire rather than to affirm.”
        
        Maya Angelou, poet and civil rights activist: “I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”
        
        Maria Montessori, Italian physician best known for the education philosophy that bears her name: “One test of the correctness of educational procedure is the happiness of the child.”
        
        Jaime Escalante, calculus teacher whose life inspired the film “Stand and Deliver”: “If we expect kids to be losers they will be losers; if we expect them to be winners they will be winners. They rise, or fall, to the level of the expectations of those around them, especially their parents and their teachers.”
        
        Mary McLeod Bethune, civil rights activist and co-founder of Bethune-Cookman University: “We have a powerful potential in our youth, and we must have the courage to change old ideas and practices so that we may direct their power toward good ends.”
        
        Dorothy Height, civil rights and women’s rights activist: “You never teach a subject, you always teach a child. You teach children in a way that they will learn, and then things will fall in place for them.”</p>
